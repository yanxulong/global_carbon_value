This repository focuses on calculating the global carbon sequestration value as part of the Global Gross Ecosystem Product (GGEP) project.The quantity method is based on [Spawn and Gibbs (2020)](https://daac.ornl.gov/VEGETATION/guides/Global_Maps_C_Density_2010.html).The carbon price accounts for the social cost of carbon from  [Rennert et al. (2022)](https://www-nature-com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/articles/s41586-022-05224-9).
